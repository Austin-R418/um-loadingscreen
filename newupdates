Rules and Regulation will be posted soon! 

****General Rules****

(1). Communication

You must be able to understand, speak, and type English since we are a North American based server.

You must have a working microphone. CRP is an all-inclusive community that includes people with disabilities. If you have a disability that hinders your ability to use a microphone, please reach out to a member of the staff to facilitate another method of communication.

(2). Respect for the community

You should be respectful to other players and administrators. You should always keep in mind that whatever you do in-game, it should not infringe on others' capacity to enjoy the game. This means not sending angry or offensive OOC messages because of something that happened in the game. Do not argue with an administrator because you disagree with a ruling, fill out a ticket to deal with the issue privately. NO TROLLING players, members, police, admin, etc.

(3). Administrator Instructions/Rulings

Administrator instructions or rulings are final and non-negotiable. If an administrator's ruling seems to have been made in error the dispute should be handled outside the game via discord by creating a ticket. Please do not "DM" members of the Staff Team directly, use the proper channel within Discord or follow the proper chain of command or open a support ticket.

(4). Lying to a staff member

Do not lie to a staff member about anything related to CRP. This includes in-game matters, discord, or any other entity relating to or belonging to CRP. Do not lie in a report or ticket regarding anything, attempting to mislead a staff member by creating a fallacy simply to gain an advantage or abuse OOC mediums such as vehicle teleports or asset refunds, or falsify videos, screenshots, recording, or other pieces of evidence in refund requests, player complaints, staff complaints, or any other OOC reporting method.

(5). Circumventing a Ban

While you are banned from the server and/or Discord you are not allowed to register another account or use an alternate account until the ban period has expired. Otherwise, your other account may also be banned and your original ban extended. Dispute bans in the discord by creating a ticket.

(6). Game Modifications

You are not permitted to use a modification that grants you an advantage on the server. DO NOT install game mods that alter vehicle handling, performance, or that can gain you any type of advantage over others. Cheats, mods, plugins, scripts, cross-hairs, or any third-party additions will get you banned if you are caught cheating.

(7). Impersonating as IRL First Responder

You must provide proof of being a law enforcement officer, firefighter, paramedic, etc. if you want to publicly state you are a first responder. The verification will be sent to Stephen or Deny directly but may be requested by a member from our senior administration. Anyone refusing to verify or is caught impersonating will be removed from the community. Real first responders deserve respect, which is openly given by everyone here and be able to speak from a position of authority within the community. Exploitation of this will not be tolerated.


****Server Rules​****


(1). Going Out of Character (OOC)

RP before OOC! Players should not go OOC. If you have an issue with how RP is going, the best way to get a staff member is to create a ticket in the discord. Please, do not use the OOC to end a scene if it is not going your way, stay in the RP mindset and try to change it through RP. Ending a scene by saying or going OOC is considered FailRP. If a staff member is available in-game, doing /report can get you assistance as well. Doing /report does not guarantee that you will get a staff member right then. Going OOC during RP scenes can result in disciplinary action.

(2). Deathmatching

Killing another player for little or no engaged roleplay is strictly forbidden. Deliberately attempting to start a fight with little to no reason is also not allowed. There will be absolutely no RDM or VDM, if a traffic accident has occurred while a player was hit by a car it needs to be roleplayed out with EMS and Police.

(3). Federal Protection

You may not steal LEO/SAFR vehicles. However, you may steal items from within them (vest, spikes, etc.) but you may not take the vehicle itself. Furthermore, SASP, LSPD, SAFR, USM, and Tow ARE NOT federally protected agencies when concerning personnel. Although not federally protected they should not be targeted to such a degree that it affects role-play. Effective 06/27/2023, SAFR will be federally protected when EMS personnel are less than 3 members in the city.

(4). Power-Gaming

Power-gaming is the act of using an in-game mechanic, any external information, or a roleplay concept to favor your own character or story, and give yourself an unfair or unrealistic advantage. (No running to teleportation markers to escape, such as running into your apartment or anywhere that is not accessible by others. This includes an example of doing a robbery, getting in a chase and running to a garage, and putting your vehicle away. If you are still in your original vehicle then there should be a 10-minute wait period to store that vehicle, repair, or modify it after a pursuit.) Also, If you are asked for your federal ID in-game, you are required to give it or face disciplinary actions!

(5). Metagaming

The act of using out-of-character/external information for in-game situations. This includes stream sniping, 3rd party VOIP applications (discord calls, TS for non-LEO), etc. Any information used from watching streams, typing/reading chat, etc. will be met with disciplinary action up to and including a ban from the server.

(6). Offensive RP/Suicide RP/Combat Logging

Roleplaying any type of sexual assault such as any non-consensual touching, rape, etc. is not allowed and will result in disciplinary action. This type of behavior is unacceptable and a ban appeal will not be allowed. Suicide RP will not be accepted or tolerated. Logging off or forcibly re-spawning to avoid situations is not allowed. IF you have to log off but are in the middle of an RP situation, you will need acknowledgment from all parties involved. This includes police chases and/or medical scenes. If you know you do not have the time to complete a scenario, do not start it. If all parties involved do not agree that the scene should be ended and you log out it will be considered combat logging and be dealt with accordingly. Once you commit a crime you must wait ten minutes before logging out of the server. If you are in the middle of a scene and your game crashes or something causes you to suddenly leave, try to log back in as soon as possible and explain your situation. If you cannot get back in within 5 minutes, please create a ticket and explain what happened and whom you were involved with during your scene so we can notify them of the issue. Abusing this rule will result in disciplinary action.

(7). Zero-Tolerance Rule

The Community Roleplay has a ZERO tolerance for ANY sexually explicit conduct, sexual misconduct, or sexualization of your character of any nature (ie explicit in-game texts, actions, gestures, or ANYTHING SEXUAL RELATED) not following this rule will result in immediate disciplinary action. Rape scenes of any nature are PROHIBITED, even with consent from other players this behavior will get you both banned without the ability to appeal. Sexual harassment of any degree at any time will be handled accordingly. Zero warnings will be given for violating this rule!

Roleplaying sexual assault (such as non-consensual touching, rape, etc.) is not allowed and will result in an immediate ban. This also applies verbally, do not joke or mock sexual harassment/assault. We do not tolerate this behavior and a ban appeal will not be allowed.

Racial Slurs, Sexual Harassment, Derogatory Statements, Sexist comments, Transphobic/Homophobic terms towards others are NOT allowed. We do not take these situations lightly. If you are mentioned to the staff about this, it will result in a minimum 72 hour suspension.

(8). Interactions between your characters

Your personal characters cannot know each other from an in-character perspective. You are also not allowed to interact between the two characters ie. transferring money or any other assets between your characters or using a third-party "friend" to transfer items between your characters. If this is discovered those items will be deleted from your inventory and you will be banned immediately.

(9). Exploiting Scripts/GTA V Mechanics

Knowingly exploiting the script and/or the GTA V engine in order to gain an advantage is not allowed. This includes abusing the physics of GTA V in order to do unrealistic things such as ramping cars off cliffs and continuing to flee. For example, if you are going 75 mph and hit a barrier or pole or some heavy object, it should be played out with RP. Not continuing to drive after striking multiple barriers and other things at high speeds.

(10). Failure to Roleplay/Unrealistic RP

Failing to roleplay is strictly forbidden. CRP is a strict realistic roleplay server, you are expected to be roleplaying at all times. If a situation presents itself where rules are broken, roleplay first, and report later. Abusing in-game physics or mechanics to gain an edge over another player will result in punishment. You are expected to use script features to assist in roleplay. DO NOT continuously type in OOC chat while another player is trying to roleplay with you.

(11). Police Mistreatment and Appeal

If you feel you have been mistreated in a police situation, do not police the police. Use the proper channels (ie. speak to a supervisor, fill out a complaint form for that specific agency). Do not contact an admin unless the officer is clearly breaking a server rule. Take abuse of power as in character and report it as you see fit.

(12). RDM/VDM

RDM (Random Deathmatch): killing/attempting to kill without intent and roleplay. VDM (Vehicle deathmatch): using a vehicle to kill/attempt to kill without intent or roleplay. KEEP IN MIND THAT WE ARE A ROLEPLAY SERVER. Deadly action needs to be roleplayed. Killing on sight is not allowed as it could be seen as a form of RDM.

(13). Fear RP

Fear RP is what you would do in real life if faced with a scary situation, again it is an RP server do not treat it like a videogame and break game mechanics to get away. For example, if you are alone in an alleyway and 4 gang members hold you at gunpoint and you cannot escape without dying, you must follow FearRP. The average person would follow their demands as they are helpless in a situation of such, you wouldn't just walk away.

-If you are already in your car and someone pulls a gun on you, it is acceptable to speed away. At this time you are taking a chance on being shot/shot at.

-If the cop/suspect informs you to not touch the radio/phone this includes hitting your panic button you should comply or die.

(14). Perma-Death/Death Penalty

The administration team may choose to give your character a Death Penalty if you are considered a repeat offender of deadly crimes or show blatant toxicity with your character’s roleplay.

A player may decide to perm-death one of their characters. No player will be forced to perm-death a character, except as described above.A

1. If a player decides to do a perm-death, they must be declared dead by any on-duty EMS, use the "/me" command to inform the EMS of your intentions when they arrive on the scene.

(14). Vigilante/Superhero/Sniping RP

Vigilante/Superhero RP is not allowed. You are not Spider-Man, John Wick, Jason Bourne, Daredevil, etc. Your character is a human and should be RP'd as such. There are no Chris Kyles in the city.

(15). Server Restart

A mandatory minimum of 10 Minutes is required to pass after server restart before any crimes should be committed. This will allow all individuals time to adapt after a server restart and get prepared for any and all crime or interactions taking place within the city. All Crimes should cease 10 Minutes prior to server reset as well, this will help with getting all of our scenes wrapped up.

All bank robberies must begin at least 1 hour prior to server reset. If a non-scheduled server reset takes place all players within a scene are required to go back to that location and finish RP'ing their scene out. If you need to spawn at a garage to get a specific vehicle out to complete the scene do so and try and let the other individuals taking part in that scene know. This would be one of the only scenarios where typing something in Discord in General Chat would be acceptable about gameplay.

(16). Torture/Mutilation RP

Any form of Torture/Mutilation RP is strictly prohibited.

(17). Downed & New Life Rule

****NEW LIFE RULE****

If you are wounded and placed into Phase 1 (on your side), you do not need to hit your "G" muscle to call for EMS. They have been automatically alerted for you. It is acceptable to hit your "G" muscle in Phase 2 (flat back) to call for EMS when you are in a populated area where locals would undoubtedly call EMS for you. If you are in an area where you are unable to be found or are in a remote area with no locals you must wait out your timer to respawn. If you happen to be found by another civilian/cop you may be transported to the hospital. EMS will be utilized when they are available. However, if they happen to be busy you may wait for them to arrive at your location, wait for them at the hospital check in, or you may check in at the hospital when you've waited approximately 5 minutes to get healed. The abuse of skipping EMS is considered FailRP and will be dealt with appropriately.

Phase‌ ‌2‌:‌ ‌(On‌ ‌your‌ ‌back‌ ‌/‌ ‌Fully‌ ‌bled‌ ‌out)‌ ‌When‌ ‌in‌ ‌this‌ ‌phase‌ ‌you‌ ‌are‌ ‌considered‌ ‌‌dead‌ ‌and‌ ‌are‌ ‌required‌ ‌to‌ ‌roleplay‌ ‌it‌ ‌as‌ ‌such.‌ ‌This‌ ‌means‌ ‌‌NO‌‌ ‌speaking‌ ‌or‌ ‌interacting‌ ‌with‌ ‌those‌ ‌around‌ ‌you.‌ ‌You‌ ‌are‌ ‌‌DEAD,‌ ‌‌no‌ ‌talking‌ ‌while‌ ‌‌DEAD‌.‌ ‌You‌ ‌will‌ ‌forget‌ ‌everything‌ ‌that‌ ‌happened‌ ‌within‌ ‌the‌ ‌past‌ scene and the events leading up to that scene ‌ ‌(i.e.‌ ‌how‌ ‌you‌ ‌died,‌ ‌who‌ ‌killed‌ ‌you,‌ ‌who‌ ‌you‌ ‌were‌ ‌with,‌ ‌and‌ any‌ general‌ ‌information‌ ‌that‌ ‌you‌ ‌learned,‌ ‌etc.).‌ ‌Once‌ ‌a‌ ‌friend‌ ‌or‌ ‌EMS‌ ‌brings‌ ‌you‌ ‌back‌ ‌to‌ ‌the‌ ‌hospital‌ ‌in‌ ‌this‌ ‌phase‌ ‌(or‌ ‌you‌ ‌respawn)‌ ‌you‌ ‌are‌ ‌required‌ ‌to‌ ‌do‌ ‌as‌ ‌such.‌ ‌FORGET‌ ‌ALL SCENES THAT TIED IN TO THE MOST RECENT ONE RESULTING YOU TO BE IN PHASE 2!‌ ‌‌‌Breaking this rule will result in disciplinary action.

Furthermore, when leaving the hospital in Phase 1 or 2 you should RP as if you are still injured. This also means you should RP as if you have been injured. Example, if you fall off a cliff/shot you would not likely run around for fun but maybe you would if you were being chased by someone who might be looking to harm you.

“The Witness Loophole” refers to the ability to circumvent forgetting the prior scenes that resulted in the death of your character due to anyone that witnesses the scene informing your character of past events that lead up to your death. If anyone (you, your gang, friend etc.) is informed of the events that led to their character’s death by using this loophole everyone will be subject to a two-hour cooldown on acting in any way based on the information they receive from any witnesses. This includes specifically but is not limited to simple retaliation or confrontation. (5/1/23)

All players including law enforcement may NOT return to a scene after being placed in Phase 1 or 2 to continue fighting through the scene. If placed only into a Phase 1 (on your side), you may remember details about the scene but cannot return to assist in the fight. Once the scene is declared over, players that were out of the fight may return to the area and assist in rendering aid.

(18). Minimum LEO for Kidnappings:

There must be a minimum of 5 LEO on in order to kidnap an LEO. There must be a minimum of 2 LEO on to kidnap anyone else. There must be a minimum of 2 LEO to rob a LEO so there are adequate resources to respond. (4/3/23)

(19). Camping Illicit Areas

Camping illicit spots: Intentionally sitting on high traffic areas that lead to illicit spots (drug areas, job areas, money washing, etc.) is not allowed for the reasons of robbing individuals. Cops are also not allowed to camp drug areas for the sole purpose of making a traffic stop and busting the subject leaving the drug area. Officers are allowed to conduct surveillance to help build a bigger case.

(20). Ban Appeal

While you are banned from the server and/or Discord you are not allowed to register another account or use an alternate account until the ban period has expired. Otherwise, your other account may also be banned and your original ban extended. Ban appeals are to be done  in the discord by creating a ticket.


(21). Safe Passage Rule
Safe Passage shall be given at ALL spawn points. They are allowed to get their vehicles and leave the area. You should not follow them to force RP. When you naturally see them elsewhere at a later time, you may engage in RP.
(3/01/23)


(22). Priority Cooldown
At times, scenes can cause overwhelming drain on server resources. In order to continue promoting positive, engaging roleplay, a 15 minute priority cooldown may be activated. This will display on the screen. While in cooldown, there is to be no major crimes such as:

--Bank Robberies
--Jewelry Store Robbery
--Shootouts with Law Enforcement
--Pursuits

This type of crime can resume after the cooldown is lifted. Only staff can enact a priority cooldown, however any player could request a cooldown and staff can evaluate that on a case by case basis. This rule is expected to only be used when needed, not anytime a scene is active. It is not unreasonable that multiple crimes could occur at once, however we want the roleplay to be fun, and not overwhelming. Creating priority scenes during a cooldown could lead to disciplinary actions, loss of winnings, or both. (3/07/23).


(23). Inappropriate Names: 


If an inappropriate name is created within the discord or as a character, you may be asked by a member of staff  at any given time to delete the character. The development team will NOT be changing names.  


(24). 17+ Years of Age Server

Here at CRP we are a 17+ roleplay server. If you or a member joins that is below the age of 17, a member of staff is allowed to remove you. We as staff have the right to remove any member that does not meet an adult standard in relation to attitude or roleplay.


(25). No Intent to Roleplay

As a roleplay server, our expectation is that every interaction you have inside the city is meant to enhance and drive everyone’s roleplay including your own. This rule is to ensure QUALITY filled interaction before any shootout or violence using melees, fists, cars, etc. All members are expected to roleplay to the best of their ability at all times.

For example, to resort to shooting / killing with little roleplay reason, rather than attempting to create or continue a meaningful interaction. Constantly ambushing all the LEO or Criminals on a scene so that you can always get away, or completing actions that in direct attempt to avoid the outcome of a scene that isn't going your way. (4/3/23)

(26). Relationship/Divorce/Marriage RP

Relationship//Divorce/Marriage Roleplay is discouraged; However it is not forbidden from being roleplayed in the city.
While the above is discouraged, yet allowed, please keep in mind that Wedding Ceremonies & Divorce Hearings are forbidden from being Roleplayed in the city.

(27). Green Zones

A green zone is a designated safe area where players cannot engage in combat or cause damage to other players or their property. No combat (Fighting, Shooting etc.) allowed in the green zone. No stealing or damaging vehicles parked in the green zone. No harassing other players in the green zone in order to gain a reaction from them. No loitering/camping in the green zone to such a degree that it becomes Power Gaming. (I.e. entering the space to free from someone and claiming it as a green zone) Interactions within the green zone are to remain in character. These places include: LSPD Stations, SASP Stations, SAFR Stations, Pillbox Medical, Paleto Medical.

(28). In Character Cursing

While in character cursing is permitted, no curse words should be directed towards another player in a degrading manner. Racial Slurs, Sexual/Sexist Terms, Derogatory Statements, Transphobic/Homophobic will remain under Zero Tolerance and will be handled as such.

(29). Body Dumping

It is strictly prohibited to body dump another player or dispose of their body. You may down, flatback, and rob a player with proper roleplay behind it but you cannot move the body from the place of death. The only exception to this rule is if you are transporting to Pillbox Medical or Paleto Medical for a drop off and go.


****Disciplinary Actions****

As part of the Community Roleplay disciplinary process, we have established the following guidelines for how our Progressive Discipline will be handled. This is necessary to hold community members accountable to the rules that we have in place. For consistency across the Community, our first step will be a Coaching Opportunity, then the next issue will be a Warning, and so on and so forth. Exceptions can be made depending on the severity of the offense (e.g. Zero Tolerance). All disciplinary action has to be logged in the disciplinary tracker. Most disciplinary actions can be appealed. If the disciplinary action is sought to be appealed, a Moderation Administrator or Senior Moderation Administrator will review.

Coaching Opportunity (Moderator Approval)
Community Member Warning (Moderator approval)
-- 24hr Community Suspension and Rules Review (Moderator approval and up)
-- 72hr Community Suspension and Rules Review (Administration approval and up)
-- 7-Day Community Suspension and Rules Review (Administration approval and up)
Permanent removal from the community (Senior Administration approval and up)

Exceptions to this process will be the Zero Tolerance Ruleset. Any type of sexual roleplay or sexualization that makes anyone feel uncomfortable will result in an immediate ban. Racial Slurs, Sexual Harassment, Derogatory Statements, Sexist comments, Transphobic/Homophobic terms will result in an instant 72 hour ban. 

Community Management and Administration may authorize staff members to deviate from the outlined disciplinary actions if the case requires.


****Gang Rules****

In order for you to be a gang on The Community RolePlay, your leader must first apply by filling out the gang application. All CRP server rules are to be adhered to in addition to the gang rules. Keep in mind that administration reserves the right to remove members or gangs entirely if they see fit. A generalized 3 strike rule is in place to provide learning opportunities.

CRP Gang Definition: The definition of a gang within CRP is an approved entity of people who possess the same ideals/values who operate as a cohesive team.

Gang Probation: All new gangs will be under a 30-day probationary period. If the RP Team feels that you are not a good fit within this timeframe you will be removed. New gangs must wait until after the 30-day probation before they can add any new members to their gang. During your 30 day probation a change in leadership will not be allowed.

You are still expected to follow all CRP server rules. This includes LEO interactions. Any criminal action outside of your gang territory must still adhere to all the CRP Rules. Also please remember that CRP staff can remove your gang whitelist at any time for failure to follow server and or gang rules. This means that your gang could be disbanded.

Gang members may be subject to unprovoked violence, without knowledge or understanding. These issues need to be pushed through gang leadership to figure out what is happening prior to a ticket being opened.


Leadership change: 

If a majority vote takes place within a gang to replace the current leader, the leader of the gang will be forced to adhere to the vote and step down from leadership. Failure to comply with the vote will result in the player being removed from the gang completely.


Roster:

--Every gang must have a roster. It is the responsibility of the leader(s) to make sure it is kept up to date.
--A gang must have a minimum of 1 leader and can have a maximum of 2.
--Your gang must have at least 5 active members.
--Your gang should have no more than a maximum of 12 Members. This includes all hang-arounds and prospects. Once the server averages 75 in-city members we will increase to 15 members.
--If you are found to have more than 12 members at any given time, you will be subject to a gang strike without warning.
--Players may only be in 1 gang. 
--Members can be added at any time. However, the gang leaders must announce that a member has been added in the gang leaders chat, gang member chat, and the roster updated. If this does not happen you will be subject to a gang strike.



Gang Colors:

(1). Your gang colors will be required to be worn at all times.

(2). Gang members will be required to wear their gang color with a ski-mask or bandana over their face.

(3). Vehicles do not have to bear the specific gang color. However, you must be able to properly identify the gang members in the vehicle if you plan to act violently.

(4). Players wearing your gang colored bandana/ski mask. You are able to inform them that it is your gang color and they may be subject to rival gang violence if they do not change it. However, if they are on your gang turf you can ask them to leave and not return with it on. If they do return you are able to act accordingly.


Leaving Your Gang:

Option 1: Blood Out - If you choose to blood out a member of your gang that decides to leave the gang you would need to open a RP ticket for tracking purposes. If you choose to blood out a member of your gang that you want to remove you will need to open an RP Ticket for approval. The blood out option would need to be decided within 10 days of the member leaving or being removed from the gang.

Option 2: Jump Out - If gang leadership decides to allow a member to leave the gang or chooses to remove someone from the gang they are allowed to jump out that member. They will be required to only put them in Phase 1, steal everything from them and the gang member will need to remove all colors and gang tattoos.

Option 3: Gang members can go on the run from their gang and try to join another gang. This member would have to communicate to the gang leadership that they are doing this. If this happens gang leadership can still exercise option 1 or 2 with the same guidelines as stated above.
All of the above options pertain to anyone on the gang roster. Prospect or Hang-Around.


Gang Retaliation:

(1). All gang retaliation should be routed through gang leadership and approved by the gang leader. If retaliation occurs without being approved by the gang leader it will be the responsibility of the gang leader to discipline the member that breaks this rule.

(2). Gun violence that relates to gang retaliation is encouraged to occur on a rival, ally, or your own gang turf.

(3). There will be no kill on sight, you must RP before you initiate any violence. If you do this it will be viewed as a form of RDM.

Law Enforcement/EMS: Departments will be responsible for establishing SOP’s on how to handle gang violence. If Law Enforcement/EMS injects into the scene they are susceptible to any violence that occurs by doing so.


Gang Alliance:

(1). You are permitted 1 ally within CRP gangs.

(2). Since we have an odd number of gangs there will be one left out. If the odd number gang starts beef with a rival gang only the gang they start it with will be able to retaliate. However, if they start beef with both then both gangs or both gangs are present they are able to retaliate together.

(3). All allies will be required to announce their ally in the gang leader chat & gang member chat.

(4). If an alliance disbands, they cannot take up another ally for 30 days.


Please understand that these rules are subject to change as we RP things out in the city.

Effective 8/13/2023
